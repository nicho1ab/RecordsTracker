# Getting Started

This project creates a searchable dataset from public complaint and facility reports.

## What you can do

- Search complaint records.
- Filter by facility, date, allegation category, and finding.
- Open the original public source URL.
- Review calculated delay fields.
- Export structured data.

## Local database

Normalized ingestion results can be stored in the local SQLite database for browsing with Datasette. Stored records include source traceability fields such as source URL, raw file hash, raw path, connector name, connector version, retrieval time, and report index when available.

## Important limitation

The dataset is derived from public source reports. The public portal remains the source of record.
