# Testing Strategy

## Test categories

### Unit tests

Validate small deterministic functions such as date parsing, URL parsing, hash generation, and field extraction.

### Fixture-based extraction tests

Validate complete extraction from known raw source files into expected JSON.

### Regression tests

Every extraction bug fix must add a failing fixture or test before the fix is accepted.

### Contract tests

Validate connector output against JSON schemas and the source connector contract.

### Data quality tests

Validate internal consistency, including required fields, valid date order, allowed finding values, duplicate source URLs, and hash presence.

### Documentation tests

Validate that required documentation files exist and that data dictionary/schema updates are present when schema files change.

### Accessibility tests

Validate documentation structure and run manual or automated checks for user-facing pages before release.

## Minimum pull request requirements

- Existing tests pass.
- New or changed extraction behavior includes fixture tests.
- Bug fixes include regression tests.
- Data contract changes include schema and documentation updates.
- User-visible behavior changes include user documentation updates.
